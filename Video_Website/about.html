        <div id="aboutinfo"><h2>About Us</h2><p>NEMediaorigins as a media company can be attributed to two things: A group of high schoolers with a dream of becoming filmmakers, and a fake ornithology club. Once upon a time, at a small private high school in the suburbs of Chicago, there was a group of students who had the aspiration of starting an ornithology club. These students weren’t biologists, they weren’t nature lovers, they were kids who wanted to start a club and thought it’d be pretty hilarious if it was a bird club. So, given the educational nature of the club’s topic, the ornithology club was born; offering everything from bird walks, to a weekly “Bird of the Week” PowerPoint presentation by one of the club’s leaders. The club even sold t-shirts in the style of the famous “I (heart) New York” shirts, instead showing “I (binoculars) Birds”.<br><br>Needless to say, they were an instant hit. The club’s popularity became so widespread that eventually, it gave a fellow student a premonition that would change the course of three young lives. From there, Kevin, AJ, and Stephen began to spitball ideas for comedic shorts and sketches, and produced them in their spare time. Even after going their separate ways for college, each summer or winter break was filled with original content and personal projects, until eventually they saw opportunities to bring their talents to clients in need of quality videos. Thus, one production company and three careers in filmmaking began with a highly improvised three-episode web series about a fake ornithology club.</p></div>
